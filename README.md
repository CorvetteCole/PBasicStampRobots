# PBasicStampRobots
This is the code I've developed for our small basic robots to complete tasks in my engineering class. Feel free to take this code and modify it as you wish. The robots run a language called Stamp Pbasic.

# Important things
Any code involving light sensors will need to be edited to account for different light intensity levels put out by whatever flashlight you may be using. Additionally make sure you edit the I/O pins in the code
to match your hardware.

Enjoy!
